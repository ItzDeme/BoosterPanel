# BoosterPanel

The Booster Panel is an app used by players of RPG games (Mostly World of Warcraft). 
It's a convenience app, used for copying and pasting information of allowing them to use that information more efficiently. 
It also logs in that information everytime the " + " or " - " buttons in a text document in the same folder the app is in. 
It's great for people that sell leeches (Speed levels for lower leveled individuals).
